# webglfun
playground to mess around with webgl

# How to view
In the PLAY folder are compiled demos that have no dependencies and can be opened as is

# How to edit
In the SOURCE folder are demos that rely on the scripts in base. To edit it first move/copy it to the root of the project. Or I dunno change the reference paths.
