# webglfun
playground to mess around with webgl

# How to view
In the PLAY folder are compiled demos that have no dependencies and can be opened as is

In most of the demos spacebar is reset and you can use you mouse/wheel to rotate/zoom

# How to edit
In the SOURCE folder are demos that rely on the scripts in base. To edit it first move/copy it to the root of the project. Or I dunno change the reference paths.
